# Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm

## Overview:
The Software provided demonstrates DES decoding and encoding. Decoded text is
entered using ASCII characters. Encoded messages and keys are displayed and
edited in ASCII representations of HEX pairs.

## To Run:
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the src folder (make it the current folder)
3. In the interpreter, issue the command
>DESWindow

## Acknowledgements
This program is a result of a project for Hong Liuâ€™s ECE-549: Network Security
class. The rubric and class materials were used as a basis.

Additionally, the University of Berlin provides an excellent Document that steps
through the DES algorithm and completes all 16 rounds of key generation and
encryption.
